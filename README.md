These are some little tests consisting of only one page. (Technically one html, one css and one js file to maintain easy readability. #cheater)

Pages:

- [Typing animation](https://rafaelurben.github.io/singlepageapps/typing-animation/)
- [Erbrechner CH (heritage calculator)](https://rafaelurben.github.io/singlepageapps/erbrechner/)
